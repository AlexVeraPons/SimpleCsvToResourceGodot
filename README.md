# SimpleCsvToResourceGodot
A Godot addon that simplifies the process of converting CSV data into Godot Resources (`.tres`). This tool allows you to map CSV columns to resource properties, generate strongly-typed GDScript classes, and bulk export resources. Mainly thought for gamejams or prototypes where you want to program and design at te same time!
